# **KNOW YOUR CROWD**
### *How well do you really know your friends?*

---

## **WHAT YOU NEED**

- **3-10 players** (each with a phone)
- **1 TV or computer screen** (the main display)
- **Same WiFi network** (all devices must be connected to the same network)

---

## **SETUP**

1. Launch the game on your computer/TV - this is the main display everyone watches
2. A room code and QR code will appear on the TV screen
3. Everyone scans the QR code or goes to the displayed web address on their phone
4. Enter the room code and type your name
5. The first player to join becomes the starting host
6. Once at least 3 players have joined, the game can be started from the TV screen

---

## **HOW TO PLAY**

The game lasts **3 full rotations** - meaning everyone gets to be the host exactly 3 times. Host duty rotates in the order players joined.

### **EACH ROUND:**

**1. PICK A THEME** *(Host only - 15 seconds)*
- The current host sees 3 AI-generated themes on their phone
- Pick one (like "Guilty pleasure song" or "Biggest fear")
- The selected theme appears on the TV for everyone to see
- *If time runs out, the first theme is auto-selected*

**2. EVERYONE ANSWERS** *(60 seconds)*
- All players **except the host** type their answer on their phone
- The host waits while others answer (they'll be guessing soon!)
- Keep it short - 1 to 3 words works best
- **⚠️ Warning:** If you don't submit an answer before time runs out, you **lose 3 points** and your answer shows as "[No Answer]"
- A progress bar shows how many people have submitted

**3. HOST MATCHES ANSWERS** *(90 seconds)*
- All answers appear on the TV (shuffled randomly so the host can't cheat by order)
- The host uses their phone to match each answer to who they think wrote it
- Tap an answer, then tap a player name to match them
- The host can change matches as many times as needed before submitting
- *If time runs out, random matches are submitted automatically*

**4. THE REVEAL**
- The TV reveals each match one by one (5 seconds each)
- ✅ **Correct guess:** The host earns **+1 point**
- ❌ **Wrong guess:** No points, but it shows who actually wrote it
- **🌟 PERFECT ROUND BONUS:** If the host matches **every single answer correctly**, they earn **+3 extra bonus points!**

**5. SCOREBOARD & NEXT ROUND** *(10 seconds)*
- The scoreboard shows everyone's current total points
- The next player in rotation becomes the new host
- After 10 seconds, the next round begins automatically

---

## **WINNING**

The game ends after 3 complete rotations (everyone hosts 3 times).

**The player with the most points wins!**

Since you only earn points when you're the host, the winner is whoever best knows their friends' answers.

## **SCORING SUMMARY**

| Action | Points |
|--------|--------|
| Correct match (as host) | +1 |
| Perfect round bonus (all correct) | +3 |
| Failing to submit answer | -3 |

## **QUICK TIPS**

💡 **As a player answering:**
- Answer honestly OR strategically - being predictable helps your friends guess you, but being sneaky can throw off the host
- Don't overthink it - that 60-second timer goes fast!
- Your answer appears as "[No Answer]" if you miss the deadline (and costs you 3 points)

💡 **As the host matching:**
- Think about each person's personality, sense of humor, and interests
- Look for typing patterns or inside jokes you'd recognize
- Go with your gut - second-guessing often hurts more than helps
- A perfect round is rare but worth +3 bonus points, so try for it!

💡 **Connection tips:**
- If you get disconnected, rejoin quickly - the game gives you 15 seconds to reconnect
- Keep your phone screen awake during your turn
